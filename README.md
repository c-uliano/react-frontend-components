# React Component Library

Styled using Bootstrap.

How is this different than React Bootstrap? I'm building it from scratch so I learn more. I'm using Bootstrap to style it for now so I don't have to look at unstyled code while I focus on the functionality of the components.

So why aren't I using Headless UI, since those are basic unstyled components? Because I won't learn anything if it's already done for me.

## Components
