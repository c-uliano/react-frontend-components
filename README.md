# React Component Library

Listen, this is what I'm doing.

I'm trying to learn by doing. It's not always smooth. It's almost never linear. And it probably doesn't make sense to anyone else.

But it's working for me.

### What exactly am I doing here?

I'm building a set of basic React components. The idea is that they are functional but unstyled.

I have Bootstrap and Tailwind installed, and I should be able to style my components using either framework.

My components are using Headless UI, but have expanded beyond the components provided by Headless. But why reinvent the wheel, as everyone keeps telling me. So alright, I'm using Headless UI and building out everything else I want.

## My Components
Some of these will be reworked, using Headless UI as the basis. I'll make sure to document the updates.

Docmentation on how to use each component can be found within each component's `README.md`, linked below

- **[ColorTheme](src/components/ColorTheme/README.md)**
- **[Header](src/components/Header/README.md)**
- **[Logo](src/components/Logo/README.md)**
- **[NavLink](src/components/NavLink/README.md)**
- **[Button](src/components/Button/README.md)** WIP to integrate Headless UI and to use any css framework
