# React Component Library

Styled using Bootstrap.

How is this different than React Bootstrap? I'm building it from scratch so I learn more. I'm using Bootstrap to style it for now so I don't have to look at unstyled code while I focus on the functionality of the components.

The future goal is to strip this down so it's functional but no longer using Bootstrap for styling, so it can be used with any css framework.

## Components
