# Header

At the moment this component just houses `Logo`, `NavLink`, and `ColorTheme`. Need to set the props for each of these components separately from inside `Header`.

### Future Enhancements
- add props to `Header` that will pass down to each of these child components, so all those settings can be set at once from the `Header`
